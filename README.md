Self-built serial communication board based on an STM32 microcontroller, designed for embedded systems applications. Key features and technical details include:

• Communication Interfaces:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) interface for peripheral connectivity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) for serial communication.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• JTAG interface for in-circuit programming and debugging.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• USB for data transfer and power input.

• PCB Design and Manufacturing:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Dual-layer printed circuit board (PCB) designed using KiCad.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Fabricated by JLCPCB (PCB manufacturer).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Self-assembled using a combination of reflow oven soldering and manual hand soldering techniques.

• Power Supply:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Powered via USB connection.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Integrated Low Dropout Regulator (LDO) for stable voltage supply.

This project demonstrates proficiency in hardware design, embedded programming, and hands-on electronics assembly.
